	<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
	been the industry's standard dummy txt ever since the 1500's, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type
	and scrambled it to make a type of specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
	leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularized in the 1960s with the release
	of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
	software like Aldus Pagemaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p></div>
