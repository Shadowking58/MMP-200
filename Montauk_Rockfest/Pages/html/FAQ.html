   				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
   				<ul>
<li>Do I need to purchase advance tickets to tour the Montauk Rockfest?<br>
We highly recommend that you purchase tickets online for the date you want to attend. There are no additional fees. You can even purchase tickets the morning of your visit. If you purchase in advance, print your tickets at home or bring in your smart phone so you can display your tickets and get scanned in upon arrival. If you want to buy tickets at the museum, you can make your purchase at the Box Office.</li> <br>

<li>What if I want to buy tickets as a gift for a family member or friend?<br>
Give the gift of rock! Purchase a gift certificate and it can be redeemed for tickets anytime online or at the Box Office.</li><br> 

<li>When is the Montauk Rockfest open?<br>
Good question! The same hours the Festival itself is open: 12:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M.

<li>I like to plan ahead. Can I purchase tickets before I get there?<br>
Absolutely. You can buy adult, senior and youth general admission tickets online and print them out at home. You can also bring your smart phone to the museum and display your tickets to be scanned in upon arrival. Ticket purchases are non-refundable.</li><br>

<li>I think I'm eligible to buy my Montauk Rockfest admission tickets at a discount. How can I do that?<br>
College students, military personnel, and Northeast Ohio residents with zip codes 440, 441, 442 or 443 can buy discounted tickets at the Box Office during normal business hours. Bring a valid ID to receive your discounted admission.</li><br> 

<li>If I purchase Montauk Rockfest general admission tickets online for a specific date and am unable to use them, am I screwed?<br>
We highly recommend you buy tickets only if you know you want to visit. You can even purchase tickets the morning of your visit with no additional fees. We get it though - things come up. Bring your original tickets to the Montauk Rockfest with the credit card used for purchase and we can help you with the exchange.</li><br>

<li>I bought tickets onlineâ€”and then lost them. Oops. What do I do?<br>
If you can't find your email ticket confirmation email in any inbox, you can visit the Montauk Rockfest with the credit card used to purchase the tickets and a valid ID. We'll be able to help you out.</li><br> 

<li>I can't print my tickets at home. What should I do?<br>
Print your tickets prior to arrival. You can also bring your smart phone or a mobile device that displays ticket PDFs so we can scan you in upon arrival. If you absolutely cannot print your tickets, you can visit our Box Office with the credit card used for the purchase and a valid ID.</li><br> 

<li>Can I purchase tickets online for my group of 15 or more?<br>
Sure can! Purchase your group tickets online at a great discount. Simply choose the tickets you need and add them to your basket - it's that simple. You can purchase up to 150 tickets online for a group and can mix and match between Regular and VIP Tickets. All discounts will be automatically reflected in your cart. If you're purchasing for a group over 150, fill out our online reservation form and our Group Sales team will get your trip set up.</li><br> 

<li>I bought tickets online to a special event and, sadly, can't make it. Are my tickets transferrable?<br>
Unfortunately, there are no refunds or exchanges with these tickets, unless an artist cancels a performance.</li>
